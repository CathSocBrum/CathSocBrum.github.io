# CathSoc

As the Catholic Society at the University of Birmingham, we provide a space for students to
socialise, have fun and explore the Catholic faith. All are welcome at CathSoc, including
non-students or those at other universities, as well as non-Catholics.

## Get involved

We host a **[weekly social](/events/sunday-socials)** every Sunday during termtime at **[Newman House](/newman-house)**
after the 6pm Mass. We also run **[weekly sessions](/events/sycamore)** exploring our Faith, as well as
**[day trips](/events/day-trips)**, **[Ceilidhs](/events/ceilidh)** and our **[annual Ball](/events/ball)**. 
No membership is required to attend!

**[Become a member](/guild)** to receive discounts on our ticketed events and for the chance to vote for a new
committee every year. It only costs Â£3 for the entire year!
