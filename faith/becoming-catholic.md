# Becoming a Catholic

*Catechesis* is the process of teaching a *catechumen* (someone becoming Catholic) about the Faith.
Only God can give you the supernatural gift of faith, the gift enabling us to believe without
doubting all that God has revealed. However, through *catechesis*, you will be helped to understand
it better, and how to go about asking for it.

Once you have been catechised, you will be *initiated* into the Church:

- If you have not been baptised, you receive the sacraments of Baptism, Confirmation and
  First Communion.
- If have been baptised but not confirmed in the Catholic Church, you will receive the sacraments of
  Confirmation and First Communion.
- If you were baptised by an Eastern Orthodox or Oriental Orthodox priest, you will have also been validly confirmed. You will make a profession of faith and receive the Eucharist.

If you wish to become a Catholic, please talk to one of the chaplains or your parish priest to be
enrolled onto a catechesis course. We particularly recommend the course provided by the [Birmingham
Oratory](/birmingham-oratory-website), which is both broad and swift - please contact
[catechesis@birminghamoratory.org.uk](mailto:catechesis@birminghamoratory.org.uk) or talk to one of
the Fathers of the Oratory.
