# Prayers

As Catholics, we have many beautiful prayers. Here are a few of the most powerful:

## Our Father

Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed by thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as
it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive
those who trespass against us, and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen.

## Hail Mary

Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women, and blessed is the
fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our
death. Amen.

## Glory Be

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit. As it was in the beginning, is now,
and ever shall be, world without end, Amen.

## Apostles' Creed

I believe in God,<br/>
the Father almighty,<br/>
Creator of heaven and earth,<br/>
and in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord,<br/>
who was conceived by the Holy Spirit,<br/>
born of the Virgin Mary,<br/>
suffered under Pontius Pilate,<br/>
was crucified, died and was buried;<br/>
he descended into hell;<br/>
on the third day he rose again from the dead;<br/>
he ascended into heaven,<br/>
and is seated at the right of God the Father almighty;<br/>
from there he will come to judge the living and the dead.<br/>
I believe in the Holy Spirit,<br/>
the holy catholic Church,<br/>
the communion of saints,<br/>
the forgiveness of sins,<br/>
the resurrection of the body,<br/>
and life everlasting. Amen.
