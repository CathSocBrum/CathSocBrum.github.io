# What is Catholicism?

Catholics are Christians who agree with the teachings of the Catholic Church and regularly
participate in the *sacraments*.

The word "Catholic" is Greek and means "universal". The Catholic Church is therefore celebrated as
the Church that brings together people from across the world regardless of background.

Catholics believe all that the Church teaches to be true. This includes belief in God (Father, Son
(Jesus), and Holy Spirit), forgiveness of sins through baptism and confession, and that the Bible is
the Word of God.

## How do Catholics worship?

Unceasingly! One of the amazing things about our universal Church is that someone somewhere in the
world is always giving praise and thanks to God.

One of the ways we worship together is through Holy Mass. The Mass is a celebration of God's word in
scripture and in the Eucharist (a Sacrament where God is actually present in the form of bread a
wine).

We also worship through private or group prayer, singing hymns or psalms, or attending Adoration
(silent prayer in the presence of the Eucharist). But these are certainly not the only forms of
worship!

## Do Catholics worship Mary and the Saints?

No. This is a common misconception. We pray to Mary through traditional prayers such as the Hail
Mary as well as through more conversational prayers. As Mary is the mother of Jesus, she played a
huge role in our salvation so she offers us a direct link to God through prayer.

All believers, living or dead, are part of the Communion of Saints. Catholics often pray to saints
because they offer good examples of how to follow Christ. They can be our friends or mentors and we
may pray to them for support and guidance in our daily lives or to show us how to be faithful to
God's will.

## What are the Sacraments?

The Church has seven Sacraments:

| **Baptism** | The washing away of all sin, both original and personal |
| **Confirmation** | The final Rite of Initiation into the Church |
| **Eucharist** | Receiving Jesus Christ's flesh and blood |
| **Penance** | We humbly confess our sins to a priest |
| **Matrimony** | A man and a woman unite themselves in marriage until separated by death |
| **Holy Orders** | A man is ordained as a deacon, priest or bishop |
| **Anointing of the Sick** | Physical and spiritual strength is conferred to a sick person, especially near the time of death |

Sacraments are outward signs which confer inward grace given to us by God. For example, when we are baptised,
God freely gives us the gift of forgiveness by His grace.
