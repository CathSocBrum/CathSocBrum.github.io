Hey CathSoc!! ðŸ˜Š

Hope youâ€™re all having a lovely week, and good luck for any remaining exams! This
Sunday, weâ€™ll be making some decorations for our Ball on Saturday the 18th! (So
exciting!!) Alongside crafts, weâ€™ll be having a cheese and wine night, so feel free to
bring some drinks if you fancy!

See you then.
