# Sunday Socials

During termtime, we get together at Newman House after the 6pm Mass for our weekly social. We
delight in delicious free food, catch up with friends and take part in that week's mayhem!

At our weekly social, we've hosted:

- Quizzes
- Arts and Crafts
- Bake-Off
- Light Party
- CathSoc Olympics

and much more! Come along, meet new friends and get stuck in!
