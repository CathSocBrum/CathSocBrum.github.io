# Cathsoc Ball

Our annual ball takes place at the end of year in June. It's a chance to dress up, celebrate the
year and meet new people. Every year, guests enjoy a 3-course meal, live music and plenty of free
alcohol.

## Ball 2022

Our 2022 Ball was the first Ball in three years due to Covid. Committee members spent 3 days
preparing food and decorating the hall. We all had a blast, enjoying delicious food and live music
in a gorgeous venue.
