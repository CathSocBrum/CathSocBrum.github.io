# Sycamore

Every Friday evening during termtime, we meet at St. Francis Hall in the Oasis Room at 6.30pm (after
the 6pm Mass) to explore the Catholic Faith. Currently we're following Sycamore, a course exploring
questions about life and faith designed around group discussion. It's a great opportunity to learn more about the Faith and to have fascinating conversations, so don't miss out
